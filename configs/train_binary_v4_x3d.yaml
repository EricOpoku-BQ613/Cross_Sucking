# configs/train_binary_v4_x3d.yaml
#
# X3D-M backbone for binary ear/tail classification on v4 data.
#
# X3D-M (Expanded 3D - Medium):
#   - 2048-dim features
#   - Pretrained on Kinetics-400
#   - Only ~3.0M params (extremely efficient)
#   - Channel-wise separable convolutions
#   - Progressive expansion of width/depth/resolution
